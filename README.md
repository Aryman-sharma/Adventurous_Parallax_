# The Parallax Effect

**The parallax** effect is a visual phenomenon that happens when objects at different distances appear to move at different speeds when you look at them from different angles.  
it's like when you're in a car and objects close to the road seem to pass by quickly, while objects far away seem to move more slowly. That difference in speed is a result of the parallax effect and helps your brain understand the distances between objects.
